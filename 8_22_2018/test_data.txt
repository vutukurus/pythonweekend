We declared this variable f to open a file named textfile.txt. 
Open takes 2 arguments, the file that we want to open and a 
string that represents the kinds of permission or operation we want to do on the file
Here we used "w" letter in our argument,
which indicates write this and the plus sign that means it will create a file if it does not exist in library
The available option beside "w" are "r"
for read and "a" for append his and plus sign means if it is not there then create it
